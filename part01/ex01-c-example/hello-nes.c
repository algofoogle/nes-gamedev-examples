/*
    Hello, NES!
    Writes a message to the screen and plays a tone.

    Originally written by WolfCoder (2010). See:

    Modified slightly by Anton Maurovic (2013) for:
    http://anton.maurovic.com/posts/nintendo-nes-gamedev-part-1-setting-up/

    Build with cc65 as follows:
        cl65 -t nes hello-nes.c -o hello.nes

    This example will use a default CHR ROM that comes with the cc65
    target files for NES.
